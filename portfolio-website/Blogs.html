                    <h1>How I Built My Portfolio Website from Scratch</h1>
                    <p class="text">



                        When I first started learning web development, I wanted to create something that truly
                        represented me. So instead of using a pre-made template, I decided to build my own portfolio
                        website from scratch — using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

                        The first step was design planning. I sketched a layout that felt clean, modern, and
                        minimal. I
                        wanted every section — from “About Me” to “Projects” — to flow naturally. Choosing colors
                        was a
                        fun part too; I went for a dark background with soft contrast to make the text and icons
                        pop.
                        Then came the real challenge — coding it all together.
                        <span class="extra">
                            I structured everything in HTML, styled with responsive CSS, and added interactivity through
                            JavaScript. To make the text animation smooth, I used Type.js, which cycles through
                            different
                            titles like “Developer”, “Designer”, “Learner”. The toughest part was ensuring the site
                            looked
                            great on both laptops and mobiles — but learning how to make layouts responsive gave me a
                            lot of
                            confidence.

                            Seeing my ideas come alive in the browser was one of the most satisfying moments. My
                            portfolio
                            is still evolving, but every change reflects how much I’ve grown as a developer. Adding a
                            blog
                            section was my next step — a space where I can share what I’m learning and creating.

                    <h1>Balancing Code and Life: How I Stay Productive and Happy</h1>
                    <p class="text">
                        As a computer engineering student who spends hours coding, I’ve realized that balance is the key
                        to staying productive and creative. It’s easy to get lost in endless lines of code, but I make
                        sure to step away sometimes — to play cricket, strum my guitar, or just spend time outdoors.

                        Cricket helps me clear my head. It teaches teamwork and focus — skills that surprisingly
                        translate well into coding. On the other hand, guitar gives me a creative outlet; whenever I
                        play, it reminds me that rhythm and logic can coexist beautifully.
                        <span class="extra">
                            I try to follow a simple routine: study and code during focused hours, take short breaks,
                            and dedicate evenings to something non-digital. These small breaks reset my mind and help me
                            return to projects with fresh ideas.

                            For me, coding isn’t just about solving problems — it’s also about enjoying the process. And
                            that’s only possible when I keep a healthy balance between technology and real life.

                    <h1>Why I Started Learning Web Development (and Why I Love It)</h1>
                    <p class="text">
                        My journey into web development began with curiosity. I was always fascinated by how websites
                        worked — how a few lines of code could turn into something visual and interactive. During my
                        early days in computer engineering, I started experimenting with HTML and CSS, and that’s where
                        it all began.

                        At first, I struggled — layouts broke, colors mismatched, and sometimes nothing displayed at
                        all. But every bug I fixed gave me a sense of achievement. Slowly, I started to understand the
                        logic behind structure and styling. Learning JavaScript made everything even more exciting; it
                        felt like giving life to static pages.
                        <span class="extra">
                            What I love most about web development is that it combines logic and creativity. I can
                            design something beautiful and still make it functional with code. Every new project teaches
                            me something — about design, patience, and problem-solving.

                            Looking ahead, I want to keep improving — learning modern frameworks, exploring backend
                            development, and maybe even building tools that help others learn to code. Web development
                            isn’t just a skill anymore — it’s become my way of expressing ideas.
